# letter-t's Vencord Fork

(A fork of) The cutest Discord client mod

## Changes Made in this Fork

-   User plugins added:
    -   FixedTimestamps: allows for editing the timestamp formats that Discord shows. Similar to the BetterDiscord plugin that allows you to change the timestamps shown on messages.
    -   UndraggableIcons: makes server icons undraggable
    -   AvatarHover: shows an enlarged version of profile pictures, emojis, and more when holding Ctrl
    -   AutoBypass: bypasses chat filters for many automoderation bots (PLEASE USE RESPONSIBLY)
    -   \[HIDDEN\] Project2: hidden due to its potential to be modified and used for raiding
-   NOTE: all changes made to package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml are only required for Project2 (which is not present here)

<details>
<summary>Using Vencord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Vencord in a server where you might get banned for it
